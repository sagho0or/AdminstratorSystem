    Required one-to-many without cascade delete
    By convention, required relationships are configured to cascade delete; this means that when the principal is deleted, all of its dependents are deleted as well, since dependents cannot exist in the database without a principal. It's possible to configure EF to throw an exception instead of automatically deleting dependent rows that can no longer exist:

In the described scenario, each assessment has a relationship with a module. An assessment is a component or part of a module, representing a specific evaluation or testing item within that module. Each module can have one or more assessments, and each assessment is associated with a particular module.

In the class structure or database schema, you might represent this relationship by having a collection of assessments within the Module class. Here's a simplified example:

csharp
Copy code
public class Module
{
    public string ModuleCode { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }

    // Collection navigation property
    public List<Assessment> Assessments { get; set; }
}

public class Assessment
{
    public int AssessmentId { get; set; }
    public int MaxMark { get; set; }
    public int ObtainedMark { get; set; }

    // Foreign key
    public string ModuleCode { get; set; }
    public Module Module { get; set; }
}
In this example:

The Module class has a collection navigation property Assessments, indicating that it can have multiple assessments associated with it.
The Assessment class has a foreign key ModuleCode that establishes a relationship with the Module class. The Module property represents the navigation property to the associated module.


______________________
program and cohort : 

The Program class represents a degree program. It contains properties such as ProgramId as the identifier, ProgramTitle for the program name, and DurationInYears to specify its duration.
It has a collection of Module instances that the program offers and a collection of Cohort instances associated with it.
The Cohort class represents a group of students registered for a specific Program in a given academic session (AcademicSession). It has a reference to the associated Program and a collection of Student instances who belong to that cohort.
In this scenario, a Cohort doesn't directly inherit from Program but maintains a relationship with it. Each Cohort is associated with a specific Program, and students are registered within a Cohort under a particular Program.


In your scenario:

A Student can be associated with multiple Modules.
A Module is part of a Course.
A Course has many Modules.
A Student has a mark and result associated with each Module and the Course.
